"""normalize.py -- convert the patient's file to the one standard format, carrying provenance
(INTAKE-2), then restore ALT (INTAKE-3).

Mechanical. Every policy that could go more than one way is a REQUIRED argument with no
default, so the agent chooses it and the choice lands in provenance rather than in this file:
duplicate positions, haploid rows, and ALT restoration each have to be named on the command line.

What it does NOT do: resolve strand. Palindromic (A/T, C/G) ambiguity survives into the
normalized file on purpose and is settled at matching time (SCO-4). A silent flip here would
erase provenance.

The standard format for this slice: bgzipped VCF on the patient's own build, plus a
provenance.json sidecar. Stages read the sidecar, never the file extension.

Usage:
  python3 tools/normalize.py --run slice-001 \
