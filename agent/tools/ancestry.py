"""ancestry.py -- reference PCA, bias-corrected projection, and distances (ANC-1, ANC-6).

Mechanical. It computes coordinates and distances and reports them. It does NOT assign an
ancestry group, does not apply a posterior cutoff, and does not decide whether a distance is
close enough. Those are the agent's (ANC-1's classifier step), and the reason they are not
here is that the cutoff `ANC-1` refers to is recorded by R5 as NOT ESTABLISHED in the retrieved
literature -- it lives in gnomAD production docs. Inventing one in a script would be exactly
the hardcoded interpretation ARCH-5 forbids.

Two projections are produced, on purpose:
  * simple projection -- query genotypes times reference loadings. Known to be biased:
    shrinkage pulls the query toward the origin, i.e. toward the centre of the reference
    cloud, and the bias is DIRECTIONAL, distorting exactly the non-European and admixed
    queries FRAME-3 says the product serves worst.
  * ADP (data augmentation, decomposition, Procrustes) -- the LASER/TRACE correction, which
    Zhang 2020 reports as unbiased. Its cost is one extra PCA per query, which is irrelevant
    here because there is exactly one query (R5 makes this point explicitly).
ANC-6 requires the corrected one. Both are reported so the shrinkage is visible, not asserted.

    Computed in sample space: with ~2.5k samples the Gram matrix is small and its
    eigendecomposition is exact, so no randomised SVD and no approximation is involved.
    Missing genotypes are mean-filled FOR THE PCA ONLY -- this is a projection, not a score, so
    JC-2's no-fabrication rule is not in play here; nothing from this path reaches the PRS.

    Returns RAW eigenvectors, deliberately NOT scaled by sqrt(eigenvalue). The Procrustes step
    below fits ONE global scale rho against plink2's ref_pca.eigenvec, and plink writes that file
    unscaled -- eigenvalues go to ref_pca.eigenval separately, and every eigenvec column has norm
    exactly 1. A single rho can only reconcile the two sides if every PC needs the same factor,
    so both sides have to carry the same convention.

    Scaling this side alone by sqrt(eigenvalue) imposes a per-PC factor spanning about 10x. (For
    this reference the sqrt of ref_pca.eigenval runs 14.13 on PC1 down to 1.38 on PC20; the
    factors that actually operate come from the augmented decomposition and are query-dependent,
    but the spread is the same.) rho then splits the difference -- measured on the recorded runs
    it lands near 0.14-0.15 -- which leaves PC1 roughly 2x too large and PC5-PC20 roughly 5x too
    small. The largest factor error is on the trailing PCs; the consequential one is on PC1 and
    PC2, where the ancestry signal is and where the residual reached ~1.0 reference sd, i.e. worse
    than predicting the group mean on that axis.

    TRACE and FRAPOSA instead scale BOTH sides. That is a different fit, not an equivalent one --
    a rotation does not commute with a non-scalar diagonal -- and on the runs measured here it is
    better still on PC1-PC4 than scaling neither. It is a larger change than this one and has not
