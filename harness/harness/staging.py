"""Building a sandbox from scratch, and proving it was built from scratch.

Two ideas do all the work here.

The first is the APFS clone. refdata is 27 GB and the brief assumed it had to be shared
read-only because copying it was impossible. Measured on this machine: `cp -Rc` clones all
753 files in 247 ms with free disk unchanged, and the clone is independent -- writing to it
does not touch the original. So refdata is not shared at all. Every run gets its own, which
removes the symlink and therefore the traversal question, and -- far more importantly --
makes it possible to DELETE things from it. A shared mount could never have done that, and
three subtrees have to go: they were built by subsetting 1000 Genomes through the patient's
own array positions.

The second is that staging is recorded as it happens, file by file, with hashes. The
manifest is not written from a description of what should have been staged; it is written
from what was.

Nothing here modifies agent/ or reference-provider/. Scrubbing operates on the copy.

# then could not be written, login succeeded but the credential could not be saved, and the
# machine's Claude Code auth failed with "OAuth access token has been revoked" -- a symptom
# that points nowhere near a file mode.

    A hardlink is a second name for the same inode. If a staged file were hardlinked to
    something outside the sandbox, a write through the sandboxed name would change the
    original -- and Seatbelt's path-based rules cannot see it, because there is only one
    inode and the deny rule matches the other path.

    The APFS clone does NOT create hardlinks (clonefile makes independent copy-on-write
    inodes, which is why writing to the clone leaves the original untouched), so a link
    count above one here means something else made it and it should stop the run.

    ONE EXEMPTION, LINUX ONLY: the refdata clone.

    Linux has no clonefile. `cp -al` is the only way to stage a 48 GB refdata tree per
    case, and it hardlinks, so on that platform every file in the clone trips this gate.

    The exemption is safe because the premise above does not hold there. Under bubblewrap
    the clone is bind-mounted read-only over itself, and a read-only mount is enforced by
    the kernel at write time rather than by matching a path, so every name for the inode
    inside the namespace returns EROFS. Inode aliasing gains nothing against it.

    It is also measured rather than asserted: the write probe attempts
    refdata/.harness_write_probe under the agent's own profile on every run and fails the
    run if it succeeds. On macOS this gate is the only line; on Linux it is the second of
    two, and the first one is tested every time.
