"""The launch gate: measure the boundary instead of asserting it.

Three checks run before any agent starts, and any one of them can stop the run.

  1. The denial probe. A process runs under the IDENTICAL profile the agent will get and
     attempts to read every path on the forbidden list, recording the errno for each. An
     unexpected success fails the run. This is the difference between "we thought about it"
     and "we checked this run" -- and it is the only check that would catch a staging bug
     that accidentally allow-lists a parent directory, because the profile is allow-default
     and a path the profile forgets is simply permitted.

  2. The write probe. Under bubblewrap a read-only bind is enforced by the kernel rather
     than by file modes, so this confirms the refdata clone is read-only to the process and
     that the real CLI state dir and anything outside the sandbox is unwritable -- which is
     what makes the no-cache guarantee hold, since nothing can be deposited for a later run
     to find. Most of these paths are not merely unwritable here: they are not in the
     namespace at all, so the errno is ENOENT rather than EPERM. The probe records "absent"
     as its own state and does not treat it as a pass.

  3. The token grep. Everything actually staged is scanned for the answer-key strings. This
     is the check that converts the survey's findings into evidence: the survey found the
     trait and two candidate model ids in pgs_catalog.py's docstring, and this is what
     proves they are gone from the copy the agent will read. Unchanged from the macOS
     probe, deliberately: both platforms grade against the same definition of a leak.

LINUX BUILD. The Spotlight checks have no equivalent and are replaced; everything else is
the macOS probe unaltered.

The probe program is fed to python3 over STDIN and writes its results to STDOUT. It is never
written to the sandbox filesystem, because the list of forbidden paths is itself a map of
where the answers live -- staging the probe would hand the agent the very thing the probe
exists to keep from it.
