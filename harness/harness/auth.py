"""Where the agent's credential comes from, and the refusal when there is none.

The token used to come from whatever shell launched the harness, and three times it was
not there. A shell opened before the `.bashrc` line was added carries no
CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, nothing about that shell looks wrong, and every case then dies in
seconds with `Not logged in`. Attended, that costs one run and five minutes. Unattended, it
is a whole corpus spent producing four hundred identical failures that look like results
until somebody opens one.

So the token is read from a file, which either has it or does not, and a run that cannot
find one does not start. A refusal costs a second. A batch that runs unauthenticated costs
the night, and the failures it banks are indistinguishable from findings.

Nothing in this module may import from the rest of the package: it runs before staging,
from two entry points, one of which lives outside the repo tree.

# results/<arm>/<pass>/<case>/, which may be committed. So a token passed through
# build_env lands in the evidence tree four times a run unless it is redacted on the way
# in. This is not hypothetical: manifests already written on the VM carry it.
#
# Redaction is BY KEY NAME, never by the shape of the value. A redactor that greps for
# `sk-ant-` works until the day the token format changes, then silently stops, and the way
# you find out is a credential in a public repository. The key name is the part the harness
# controls and the part that does not drift.
#
# The key is kept and its value replaced, rather than the key being dropped. A reader has
# to be able to tell that auth WAS configured for a run -- that is exactly the question a
# run which died with `Not logged in` raises, and a missing key cannot answer it.
